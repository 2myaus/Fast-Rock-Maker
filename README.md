# Fast-Rock-Maker

Fast Rock Maker, or FastRM, is a 2d cave-generation library focused on speed and usability in games.
It uses a simple model of erosion to guarantee that a generated cave will be continous - there is always at least one path from one point in the cave to another.
This means that it is practical to use in a large exploration game without the ability to break blocks to move from section to section.

The project is still in development so there are no official releases, but a working demonstration can be built from the source code.
